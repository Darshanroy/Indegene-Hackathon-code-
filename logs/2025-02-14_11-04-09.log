This description is mainly of gross structural features,\nboth external and internal. In addition, observable and perceivable\nliving phenomena were also recorded as part of this description. Before\nexperimental biology or more specifically, physiology, was established\nas a part of biology, naturalists described only biology. Hence, biology\nremained as a natural history for a long time. The description, by itself,\nwas amazing in terms of detail. While the initial reaction of a student\ncould be boredom, one should keep in mind  that the detailed description,\nwas utilised in the later day reductionist biology where living processes\ndrew more attention from scientists than the description of life forms\nand their structure. Hence, this description became meaningful and\nhelpful in framing research questions in physiology or evolutionary\nbiology. In the following chapters of this unit, the structural organisation\nof plants and animals, including the structural basis of physiologial or\nbehavioural phenomena, is described. For convenience, this description\nof morphological and anatomical features is presented separately for\nplants and animals.\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANISATION\nIN PLANTS AND ANIMALS\nChapter 5\nMorphology of\nFlowering Plants\nChapter 6\nAnatomy of Flowering\nPlants\nChapter 7\nStructural Organisation in\nAnimals\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:30:12+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:57+05:30', 'title': 'ch-5.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo105.pdf', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='KATHERINE ESAU was born in Ukraine in 1898.

It\nprotects the tender apex of the root as it makes\nits way through the soil. A few millimetres above\nthe root cap is the region of meristematic\nactivity.  The cells of this region are very small,\nthin-walled and with dense protoplasm. They\ndivide repeatedly. The cells proximal to this\nregion undergo rapid elongation and\nenlargement and are responsible for the growth\nof the root in length. This region is called the\nregion of elongation. The cells of the elongation\nzone gradually differentiate and mature. Hence,\nthis zone, proximal to region of elongation, is\ncalled the region of maturation .  From this\nregion some of the epidermal cells form very fine\nand delicate, thread-like structures called root\nhairs . These root hairs absorb water and\nminerals from the soil.\nFigure 5.3  The regions of the root-tip\n5.2 THE STEM\nWhat are the features that distinguish a stem from a root? The stem is the\nascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. It\ndevelops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem\nbears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are\nborn are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes.\nThe stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally\ngreen when young and later often become woody and dark brown.\nThe main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing\nleaves, flowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates.\nSome stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection\nand of vegetative propagation.\n5.3 THE LEAF\nThe leaf is a lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem. It\ndevelops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The \naxillary bud later\ndevelops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and\nare arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative\norgans for photosynthesis.\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:30:12+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:57+05:30', 'title': 'ch-5.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo105.pdf', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='60 BIOLOGY\nA typical leaf consists of three main parts:  leaf\nbase, petiole and lamina (Figure 5.4 a). The leaf is\nattached to the stem by the leaf base and may bear\ntwo lateral small leaf like structures called stipules.\nIn monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a\nsheath covering the stem partially or wholly. In some\nleguminous plants the leafbase may become\nswollen, which is called the \npulvinus. The petiole\nhelp hold the blade to light. Long thin flexible\npetioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind, thereby\ncooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface.\nThe lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded\npart of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is,\nusually, a middle prominent vein, which is known\nas the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade\nand act as channels of transport for water, minerals\nand food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface\nand extent of incision of lamina varies in different\nleaves.\n5.3.1 Venation\nThe arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the\nlamina of leaf is termed as venation . When the\nveinlets form a network, the venation is termed as\nreticulate (Figure 5.4 b). When the veins run\nparallel to each other within a lamina, the venation\nis termed as parallel (Figure 5.4 c). Leaves of\ndicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate\nvenation, while parallel venation is the characteristic\nof most monocotyledons.\n5.3.2 Types of Leaves\nA leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire\nor when incised, the incisions do not touch the\nmidrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up\nto the midrib breaking it into a number of leaflets,\nthe leaf is called compound. A bud is present\nin the axil of petiole in both simple and compound\nleaves, but not in the axil of leaflets of the compound\nleaf.\nThe compound leaves may be of two types\n(Figure 5.5).

This is usually\nof three types – alternate, opposite and\nwhorled (Figure 5.6). In alternate type of\nphyllotaxy,  a single leaf arises at each node\nin alter nate manner , as in china r ose,\nmustard and sun flower plants. In opposite\ntype, a pair of leaves arise at each node and\nlie opposite to each other as in Calotropis and\nguava plants. If more than two leaves arise\nat a node and form a whorl, it is called\nwhorled, as in Alstonia.\n5.4 THE INFLORESCENCE\nA flower is a modified shoot wherein the shoot\napical meristem changes to floral meristem.\nInternodes do not elongate and the axis gets\ncondensed. The apex produces different\nkinds of floral appendages laterally at\nsuccessive nodes instead of leaves.  When a\nshoot tip transforms into a flower, it is always\nsolitary. The arrangement of flowers on the\nfloral axis is termed as inflorescence .\nDepending on whether the apex gets\ndeveloped into a flower or continues to grow,\ntwo major types of inflorescences are defined\n– racemose and cymose. In racemose type\nof inflorescences the main axis continues to\ngrow, the flowers are borne laterally in an\nacropetal succession (Figure 5.7).\nIn cymose type of  inflorescence the main\naxis terminates in a flower, hence is limited\nin growth.The flowers are borne in a basipetal\norder (Figure 5.7).\nFigure 5.6 Different types of phyllotaxy :\n(a) Alternate (b) Opposite\n(c) Whorled\n(c) Alstonia\n(a) China rose\n(b) Guava\nFigure 5.7   Racemose inflorescence\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:30:12+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:57+05:30', 'title': 'ch-5.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo105.pdf', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content='62 BIOLOGY\n5.5 THE FLOWER\nThe flower is the reproductive unit in the\nangiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction.\nA typical flower has four different kinds of whorls\narranged successively on the swollen end of the\nstalk or pedicel, called thalamus or receptacle.\nThese are calyx, corolla, androecium and\ngynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory\norgans, while androecium and gynoecium are\nreproductive organs. In some flowers like lily, the\ncalyx and corolla are not distinct and are termed\nas perianth. When a flower has both androecium and gynoecium, it is\nbisexual. A flower having either only stamens or only carpels is\nunisexual.\nIn symmetry, the flower may be actinomorphic (radial symmetry) or\nzygomorphic (bilateral symmetry). When a flower can be divided into\ntwo equal radial halves in any radial plane passing through the centre, it\nis said to be actinomorphic, e.g., mustard, datura, chilli. When it can be\ndivided into two similar halves only in one particular vertical plane, it is\nzygomorphic, e.g., pea, gulmohur, bean, Cassia. A flower is asymmetric\n(irregular) if it cannot be divided into two similar halves by any vertical\nplane passing through the centre, as in canna.\nA flower may be trimerous, tetramerous or pentamerous when\nthe floral appendages are in multiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively. Flowers\nwith bract\ns-reduced leaf found at the base of the pedice l-are called\nbracteate and those without bracts, ebracteate.\nFigure 5.8   Cymose inflorescence\nFigure 5.9 Position of floral parts on thalamus : (a) Hypogynous (b)  and (c)\nPerigynous  (d) Epigynous\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:30:12+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:57+05:30', 'title': 'ch-5.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo105.pdf', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 63\nBased on the position of calyx, corolla and androecium in respect of\nthe ovary on thalamus, the flowers are described as hypogynous,\nperigynous and epigynous (Figure 5.9). In the hypogynous flower the\ngynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated\nbelow it. The ovary in such flowers is said to be superior, e.g., mustard,\nchina rose and brinjal. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other\nparts of the flower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the\nsame level, it is called \nperigynous. The ovary here is said to be half\ninferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous flowers, the margin of\nthalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused\nwith it, the other parts of flower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is\nsaid to be inferior as in flowers of guava and cucumber , and the ray\nflorets of sunflower.\n5.5.1 Parts of a Flower\nEach flower normally has four floral whorls, viz., calyx, corolla,\nandroecium and gynoecium (Figure 5.10).\n5.5.1.1 5.5.1.15.5.1.1 5.5.1.15.5.1.1 Calyx CalyxCalyx CalyxCalyx\nThe calyx is the outermost whorl of the flower and the members are called\nsepals. Generally, sepals are green, leaf like and protect the flower in the\nbud stage. The calyx may be gamosepalous (sepals united) or\npolysepalous (sepals free).\n5.5.1.2 5.5.1.25.5.1.2 5.5.1.25.5.1.2 Corolla CorollaCorolla CorollaCorolla\nCorolla is composed of petals. Petals are usually brightly coloured to\nattract insects for pollination. Like calyx, corolla may also be\ngamopetalous (petals united) or polypetalous (petals free). The shape\nand colour of corolla vary greatly in plants. Corolla may be tubular, bell-\nshaped, funnel-shaped or wheel-shaped.\nAestivation: The mode of arrangement of sepals or petals in floral bud\nwith respect to the other members of the same whorl is known as\naestivation. The main types of aestivation are valvate, twisted, imbricate\nPedicel\nCalyx\nCorolla\nAndroecium\nGynoecium\nFigure 5.10  Parts of a flower\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:30:12+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:57+05:30', 'title': 'ch-5.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo105.pdf', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 9, 'page_label': '10'}, page_content='64 BIOLOGY\nand vexillary (Figure 5.11). When sepals or petals in a whorl just touch\none another at the margin, without overlapping, as in Calotropis, it is\nsaid to be \nvalvate. If one margin of  the appendage overlaps that of the\nnext one and so on as in china rose, lady’s finger and cotton, it is called\ntwisted.  If the margins of sepals or petals overlap one another but not in\nany particular direction as in Cassia and gulmohur, the aestivation is\ncalled imbricate. In pea and bean flowers, there are five petals, the largest\n(standard) overlaps the two lateral petals (wings) which in turn overlap\nthe two smallest anterior petals (keel);  this type of aestivation is known\nas vexillary or papilionaceous.\n5.5.1.3 5.5.1.35.5.1.3 5.5.1.35.5.1.3 AndroeciumAndroeciumAndroeciumAndroeciumAndroecium\nAndroecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which represents the\nmale reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a filament and an anther.\nEach anther is usually bilobed and each lobe has two chambers, the\npollen-sacs. The pollen grains are produced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen\nis called staminode.\nStamens of flower may be united with other members such as petals\nor among themselves. When stamens are attached to the petals, they are\nepipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when attached to the perianth\nas in the flowers of lily. The stamens in a flower may either remain free\n(polyandrous) or may be united in varying degrees. The stamens may be\nunited into one bunch or one bundle (monoadelphous) as in china rose,\nor two bundles (diadelphous)  as in pea, or into more than two  bundles\n(polyadelphous) as in citrus. There may be a variation in the length of\nfilaments within a flower, as in Salvia and mustard.\nFigure 5.11  Types of aestivation in cor olla : (a) V alvate (b) T wisted (c) Imbricate (d) V exillary\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:30:12+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:57+05:30', 'title': 'ch-5.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo105.pdf', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='MORPHOLOGY OF FLOWERING PLANTS 65\n5.5.1.4 5.5.1.45.5.1.45.5.1.45.5.1.4 GynoeciumGynoeciumGynoeciumGynoeciumGynoecium\nGynoecium is the female reproductive part of the flower and is made\nup of one or more carpels. A carpel consists of three parts namely\nstigma, style and ovary. Ovary is the enlarged basal part, on which\nlies the elongated tube, the style. The style connects the ovary to the\nstigma. The stigma is usually at the tip of the style and is the\nreceptive surface for pollen grains. Each ovary bears one or more\novules attached to a flattened, cushion-like placenta. When more\nthan one carpel is present, they may be free (as in lotus and rose)\nand are called apocarpous. They are termed syncarpous when\ncarpels are fused, as in mustard and tomato. After fertilisation, the\novules develop into seeds and the ovary matures into a fruit.\nPlacentation: The arrangement of ovules within the ovary is known\nas placentation. The placentation are of different types namely,\nmarginal, axile, parietal, basal, central and free central (Figure 5.12).\nIn marginal  placentation the placenta forms a ridge along the\nventral suture of the ovary and the ovules are borne on this ridge\nforming two rows, as in pea. When the  placenta is axial and the\novules are attached to it in a multilocular ovary, the placentaion is\nsaid to be axile, as in china rose, tomato and lemon. In \nparietal\nplacentation, the ovules develop on the inner wall of the ovary or\non peripheral part. Ovary is one-chambered but it becomes two-\nchambered due to the formation of the false septum, e.g., mustard\nand Argemone. When the ovules are borne on central axis and\nsepta are absent, as in Dianthus and Primrose the placentation is\ncalled free central. In basal placentation, the placenta develops\nat the base of ovary and a single ovule is attached to it, as in\nsunflower, marigold.\n5.6 THE FRUIT\nThe fruit is a characteristic feature of the flowering plants. It is a\nmature or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is\nformed without fertilisation of the ovary, it is  called a\nparthenocarpic fruit.\nGenerally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds.\nThe pericarp may be dry or fleshy. When pericarp is thick and\nfleshy, it is differentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle\nmesocarp and the inner endocarp.\nIn mango and coconut, the fruit is known as a drupe (Figure\n5.13). They develop from monocarpellary superior ovaries and are\none seeded.

The embryo is made up of a radicle, an embryonal\naxis and one (as in wheat, maize) or two cotyledons (as in gram and pea).\n5.7.1 Structure of a Dicotyledonous Seed\nThe outermost covering of a seed is the seed coat. The seed coat has two\nlayers, the outer testa and the inner tegmen. The hilum is a scar on the\nseed coat through which the developing seeds were attached to the fruit.\nAbove the hilum is a small pore called the\nmicropyle. Within the seed coat is the embryo,\nconsisting of an embryonal axis and two\ncotyledons. The cotyledons are often fleshy and\nfull of reserve food materials. At the two ends of\nthe embryonal axis are present the radicle and\nthe plumule (Figure 5.14). In some seeds such\nas castor the endosperm formed as a result of\ndouble fertilisation, is a food storing tissue and\ncalled endospermic seeds. In plants such as\nbean, gram and pea, the endosperm is not\npresent in mature seeds and such seeds are\ncalled non-endospermous.\n5.7.2 Structure of Monocotyledonous Seed\nGenerally, monocotyledonous seeds are endospermic but some as in\norchids are non-endospermic.

It\nconsists of one large and shield shaped cotyledon known as scutellum\nand \n    a short axis with a plumule and a     radicle. The plumule and radicle\nare enclosed in sheaths which are called coleoptile and\ncoleorhiza  respectively (Figure 5.15).\n5.8 SEMI-TECHNICAL  DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL\nFLOWERING  PLANT\nVarious morphological features are used to describe a\nflowering plant.

They have well developed\nroot and shoot systems. Root system is either tap root or fibrous. Generally,\ndicotyledonous plants have tap roots while monocotyledonous plants have\nfibrous roots. The roots in some plants get modified for storage of food,\nmechanical support and respiration. The shoot system is differentiated\ninto stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. The morphological features of stems\nlike the presence of nodes and internodes, multicellular hair and positively\nphototropic nature help to differentiate the stems from roots. Leaf is a\nlateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are\ngreen in colour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit\nmarked variations in their shape, size, margin, apex and extent of incisions\nof leaf blade (lamina).\nThe flower is a modified shoot, meant for sexual reproduction. The\nflowers are arranged in different types of inflorescences. They exhibit\nenormous variation in structure, symmetry, position of ovary in relation\nto other parts, arrangement of petals, sepals, ovules etc. After fertilisation,\nthe ovary is modified into fruits and ovules into seeds. Seeds either may\nbe monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous. They vary in shape, size and\nperiod of viability.

It was done instinctively not using criteria that were\nscientific but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use – for\nfood, shelter and clothing.  Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a more\nscientific basis for classification. He used simple morphological characters\nto classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals\ninto two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not.\nIn Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom  system of classification with\nPlantae  and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all\nplants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish between\nthe eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms\nand photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi)\norganisms. Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily\ndone and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms\ndid not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification\nused for a long time was found inadequate.  Besides, gross morphology\na need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure,\nnature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction,\nevolutionary relationships, etc.  Classification systems for the living\norganisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time.\nThough plant and animal kingdoms have been a constant under all\ndifferent systems, the understanding of what groups/organisms be\nincluded under these kingdoms have been changing; the number and\nnature of other kingdoms have also been understood differently by\ndifferent scientists over the time.\nB IOLOGICAL  C LASSIFICATION\nC HAPTER   2\n2.1 Kingdom Monera\n2.2 Kingdom Protista\n2.3 Kingdom Fungi\n2.4 Kingdom Plantae\n2.5 Kingdom\nAnimalia\n2.6 Viruses, Viroids\nand Lichens\n2024-25"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:16:33+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:13+05:30', 'title': 'ch-2.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo102.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='B IOLOGICAL  C LASSIFICATION 11\nR.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed a Five Kingdom Classification. The\nkingdoms defined by him were named Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae\nand Animalia.  The main criteria for classification used by him include cell\nstructure, body organisation, mode of nutrition, reproduction and\nphylogenetic relationships. Table 2.1 gives a comparative account of different\ncharacteristics of the five kingdoms.\nT he three-domain system has also been proposed that divides the Kingdom\nMonera into two domains, leaving the remaining eukaryotic kingdoms in the\nthir d domain and thereby a six kingdom classification. Y ou will learn about\nthis system in detail at higher classes.\nLet us look at this five kingdom classification to understand the issues\nand considerations that influenced the classification system. Earlier\nclassification systems included bacteria, blue green algae, fungi, mosses,\nferns, gymnosperms and the angiosperms under ‘Plants’. The character\nthat unified this whole kingdom was that all the organisms included had a\ncell wall in their cells.  This placed together groups which widely differed in\nother characteristics. It brought together the prokaryotic bacteria and the\nblue green algae ( cyanobacteria) with other groups which were eukaryotic.\nIt also grouped together the unicellular organisms and the multicellular\nones, say, for example, Chlamydomonas  and Spirogyra  were placed together\nunder algae. The classification did not differentiate between the heterotrophic\ngroup – fungi, and the autotrophic green plants, though they also showed\na characteristic difference in their walls composition – the fungi had chitin\nFive Kingdoms\nCharacters\nCell type\nCell wall\nNuclear\nmembrane\nBody\norganisation\nMode of\nnutrition\nMonera\nProkaryotic\nNoncellulosic\n(Polysaccharide\n+ amino acid)\nAbsent\nCellular\nAutotrophic\n(chemosyn-\nthetic and\nphotosynthetic)\nand Hetero-\ntrophic (sapro-\nphytic/para-\nsitic)\nProtista\nEukaryotic\nPresent in\nsome\nPresent\nCellular\nAutotrophic\n(Photosyn-\nthetic) and\nHetero-\ntrophic\nFungi\nEukaryotic\nPresent\nwith chitin\nPresent\nMulticeullar/\nloose tissue\nHeterotrophic\n(Saprophytic/\nParasitic)\nPlantae\nEukaryotic\nPresent\n(cellulose)\nPresent\nT issue/\norgan\nAutotrophic\n(Photosyn-\nthetic)\nAnimalia\nEukaryotic\nAbsent\nPresent\nT issue/or gan/\norgan system\nHeterotrophic\n(Holoz o ic/\nSaprophytic\netc.)\nT ABLE  2.1   Characteristics of the Five Kingdoms\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:16:33+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:13+05:30', 'title': 'ch-2.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo102.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='12 B IOLOGY\nin their walls while the green plants had a cellulosic cell wall.  When such\ncharacteristics were considered, the fungi were placed in a separate\nkingdom – Kingdom Fungi. All prokaryotic organisms were grouped\ntogether under Kingdom Monera and the unicellular eukaryotic organisms\nwere placed in Kingdom Protista. Kingdom Protista has brought together\nChlamydomonas, Chlorella  (earlier placed in Algae within Plants and both\nhaving cell walls) with Paramoecium  and Amoeba  (which were earlier placed\nin the animal kingdom which lack cell wall). It has put together organisms\nwhich, in earlier classifications, were placed in different kingdoms.  This\nhappened because the criteria for classification changed. This kind of\nchanges will take place in future too depending on the improvement in our\nunderstanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Over time,\nan attempt has been made to evolve a classification system which reflects\nnot only the morphological, physiological and reproductive similarities,\nbut is also phylogenetic, i.e., is based on  evolutionary relationships.\nIn this chapter we will study characteristics of Kingdoms Monera,\nProtista and Fungi of the Whittaker system of classification.

They are the most\nabundant micro-organisms. Bacteria occur almost everywhere. Hundreds\nof bacteria are present in a handful of soil. They also live in extreme habitats\nsuch as hot springs, deserts, snow and deep oceans where very few other\nlife forms can survive. Many of them live in or on other organisms as\nparasites.\nBacteria are grouped under four categories based on their shape: the\nspherical Coccus (pl.: cocci), the rod-shaped Bacillus (pl.: bacilli), the\ncomma-shaped Vibrium (pl.: vibrio) and the spiral Spirillum (pl.: spirilla)\n(Figure 2.1).\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:16:33+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:13+05:30', 'title': 'ch-2.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo102.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='B IOLOGICAL  C LASSIFICATION 13\nThough the bacterial structure is very simple, they are very complex\nin behaviour . Compar ed to many other organisms, bacteria as a gr oup\nshow the most extensive metabolic diversity. Some of the bacteria are\nautotrophic, i.e., they synthesise their own food from inorganic substrates.\nThey may be photosynthetic autotrophic or chemosynthetic autotrophic.\nThe vast majority of bacteria are heterotrophs, i.e., they depend on other\norganisms or on dead organic matter for food.\n2.1.1 Archaebacteria\nThese bacteria are special since they live in some of the most harsh habitats\nsuch as extreme salty areas (halophiles), hot springs (thermoacidophiles)\nand marshy areas (methanogens). Archaebacteria differ from other bacteria\nin having a different cell wall structure and this feature is responsible for\ntheir survival in extreme conditions. Methanogens are present in the gut\nof several ruminant animals such as cows and buffaloes and they are\nresponsible for the production of methane (biogas) from the dung of these\nanimals.\nFigure 2.2 A filamentous blue-green\nalgae – Nostoc\n2.1.2 Eubacteria\nThere are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘true\nbacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of a\nrigid cell wall, and if motile, a flagellum. The\ncyanobacteria (also referred to as blue-green algae)\nhave chlorophyll a  similar to green plants and are\nphotosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). The\ncyanobacteria are unicellular , colonial or filamentous,\nfreshwater/marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies\nare generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They\noften form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of\nthese organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen in\nspecialised cells called heterocysts,  e.g., Nostoc and\nAnabaena . Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria\noxidise various inorganic substances such as\nnitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released\nenergy for their ATP production. They play a great role\nin recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous,\niron and sulphur.\nHeterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in\nnature.

Sometimes, under unfavourable conditions,\nthey produce spores. They also reproduce by a\nsort of sexual reproduction by adopting a\nprimitive type of DNA transfer from one bacterium\nto the other .\nThe Mycoplasma are organisms that\ncompletely lack a cell wall. They are the smallest\nliving cells known and can survive without oxygen. Many mycoplasma\nare pathogenic in animals and plants.\n2.2 K INGDOM  P ROTISTA\nAll single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista , but the boundaries\nof this kingdom are not well defined. What may be ‘a photosynthetic\nprotistan’ to one biologist may be ‘a plant’ to another . In this book we\ninclude Chrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds and\nProtozoans under Protista. Members of Protista are primarily aquatic.\nThis kingdom forms a link with the others dealing with plants, animals\nand fungi. Being eukaryotes, the protistan cell body contains a well defined\nnucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Some have flagella or\ncilia. Protists reproduce asexually and sexually by a process involving\ncell fusion and zygote formation.\n2.2.1 Chrysophytes\nThis group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are found\nin fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopic\nand float passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them are\nphotosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells,\nwhich fit together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silica\nand thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behind\nlarge amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over\nbillions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty this\nsoil is used in polishing, filtration of oils and syrups. Diatoms are the\nchief ‘producers’ in the oceans.\nFigure 2.3 A dividing bacterium\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:16:33+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:13+05:30', 'title': 'ch-2.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo102.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='B IOLOGICAL  C LASSIFICATION 15\n2.2.2 Dinoflagellates\nThese organisms are mostly marine and photosynthetic.\nThey appear yellow, green, brown, blue or red depending\non the main pigments present in their cells.

Toxins released by such large\nnumbers may even kill other marine animals such as\nfishes.\n2.2.3 Euglenoids\nMajority of them are fresh water organisms found in\nstagnant water . Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein\nrich layer called pellicle which makes their body flexible.\nThey have two flagella, a short and a long one. Though\nthey are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, when\ndeprived of sunlight they behave like heterotrophs by\npredating on other smaller organisms. Interestingly, the\npigments of euglenoids are identical to those present in\nhigher plants. Example: Euglena (Figure 2.4b) .\n2.2.4 Slime Moulds\nSlime moulds are saprophytic protists. The body moves\nalong decaying twigs and leaves engulfing organic\nmaterial. Under suitable conditions, they form an\naggregation called plasmodium which may grow and\nspread over several feet. During unfavourable conditions,\nthe plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting bodies\nbearing spores at their tips. The spores possess true walls.\nThey are extremely resistant and survive for many years,\neven under adverse conditions.

There are four major groups of protozoans.\nAmoeboid protozoans:  These organisms live in fresh\nwater , sea water or moist soil.

Marine\nforms have silica shells on their surface. Some of them such as Entamoeba\nare parasites.\nFlagellated protozoans:  The members of this group are either free-living\nor parasitic. They have flagella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases such\nas sleeping sickness. Example: T rypanosoma .\nCiliated protozoans:  These are aquatic, actively moving organisms because\nof the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that opens\nto the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows of\ncilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example:\nParamoecium (Figure 2.4d) .\nSporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectious\nspore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium\n(malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggering\neffect on human population.\n2.3 K INGDOM  F UNGI\nThe fungi constitute a unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms. They\nshow a great diversity in morphology and habitat. Y ou  must have seen\nfungi on a mo i st bread and rotten fruits. The common mushroom you eat\nand toadstools are also fungi. White spots seen on mustard leaves are due\nto a parasitic fungus. Some unicellular fungi, e.g., yeast are used to make\nbread and beer . Other fungi cause diseases in plants and animals; wheat\nrust-causing Puccinia  is an important example. Some are the source of\nantibiotics, e.g., Penicillium . Fungi are cosmopolitan and occur in air , water ,\nsoil and on animals and plants.  They prefer to grow in warm and humid\nplaces. Have you ever wonder ed why we keep food in the r efrigerator ? Y es,\nit is to prevent food from going bad due to bacterial or fungal infections.\nW ith the exception of yeasts which ar e unicellular , fungi ar e\nfilamentous. Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures\ncalled hyphae. The network of hyphae is known as mycelium. Some hyphae\nare continuous tubes filled with multinucleated cytoplasm – these are\ncalled coenocytic hyphae. Others have septae or cross walls in their\nhyphae. The cell walls of fungi are composed of chitin and polysaccharides.\nMost fungi are heterotrophic and absorb soluble organic matter from\ndead substrates and hence are  called saprophytes . Those that depend\non living plants and animals are called parasites . They can also live as\nsymbionts – in association  with algae as lichens  and with roots of higher\nplants as mycorrhiza .\nReproduction in fungi can take place by vegetative means –\nfragmentation, fission and budding. Asexual reproduction is by spores\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:16:33+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:13+05:30', 'title': 'ch-2.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo102.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content='B IOLOGICAL  C LASSIFICATION 17\ncalled conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproduction\nis by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores are\nproduced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cycle\ninvolves the following  three steps:\n(i) Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes\ncalled plasmogamy.\n(ii) Fusion of two nuclei called karyogamy.\n(iii) Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores.\nWhen a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid\nhyphae of compatible mating types come together and\nfuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells\nimmediately r esults in diploid cells (2n). However , in other\nfungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening\ndikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs;\nsuch a condition is called a dikaryon  and the phase is\ncalled dikaryophase  of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei\nfuse and the cells become diploid.  The fungi form fruiting\nbodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to\nformation of haploid spores.\nThe morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore\nformation and fruiting bodies  form the basis for the\ndivision of the kingdom  into various classes.\n2.3.1 Phycomycetes\nMembers of phycomycetes are found in aquatic habitats\nand on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as\nobligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate\nand coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place by\nzoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These\nspores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A\nzygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. These\ngametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) or\ndissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous). Some common\nexamples are Mucor (Figure 2.5a), Rhizopus (the bread\nmould mentioned earlier) and Albugo (the parasitic fungi\non mustard).\n2.3.2 Ascomycetes\nCommonly known as sac-fungi, the ascomycetes  are mostly\nmulticellular , e.g., Penicillium , or  rar ely  unicellular, e.g., yeast\n( Saccharomyces ) .  They are saprophytic, decomposers,\nparasitic or coprophilous (growing on dung).

The asexual spores are conidia produced\nexogenously on the special mycelium called conidiophores. Conidia on\ngermination produce mycelium. Sexual spores are called ascospores\nwhich are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). These\nasci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps.\nSome examples are Aspergillus (Figure 2.5b) , Claviceps and  Neurospora.\nNeurospora  is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Many\nmembers like morels and truffles are edible and are considered  delicacies.\n2.3.3 Basidiomycetes\nCommonly known forms of basidiomycetes are mushrooms, bracket fungi\nor puffballs. They grow in soil, on logs and tree stumps and in living\nplant bodies as parasites, e.g., rusts and smuts. The mycelium is branched\nand septate. The asexual spores are generally not found, but vegetative\nreproduction by fragmentation is common. The sex organs are absent,\nbut plasmogamy is brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somatic\ncells of different strains or genotypes. The resultant structure is dikaryotic\nwhich ultimately gives rise to basidium. Karyogamy and meiosis take\nplace in the basidium producing four basidiospores. The basidiospores\nare exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia). The basidia are\narranged in fruiting bodies called basidiocarps. Some common members\nare Agaricus (mushroom) (Figure 2.5c) , Ustilago (smut) and Puccinia (rust\nfungus).\n2.3.4 Deuteromycetes\nCommonly known as imperfect fungi because only the asexual or\nvegetative phases of these fungi are known.  When the sexual forms of\nthese fungi were discovered they were moved into classes they rightly\nbelong to.  It is also possible that the asexual and vegetative stage have\nbeen given one name (and placed under deuteromycetes) and the sexual\nstage another (and placed under another class).  Later when the linkages\nwere established, the fungi were correctly identified and moved out of\ndeuteromycetes. Once perfect (sexual) stages of members of\ndueteromycetes were discovered they were often moved to ascomycetes\nand basidiomycetes. The deuteromycetes reproduce only by asexual spores\nknown as conidia. The mycelium is septate and branched. Some members\nare saprophytes or parasites while a large number of them are\ndecomposers of litter and help in mineral cycling.

A few members are partially\nheterotrophic such as the insectivorous plants or parasites. Bladderwort\nand V enus fly trap ar e examples of insectivorous plants and Cuscuta  is a\nparasite. The plant cells have an eukaryotic structure with prominent\nchlor oplasts and cell wall mainly made of cellulose. Y ou will study the\neukaryotic cell structure in detail in Chapter 8. Plantae includes algae,\nbryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms.\nLife cycle of plants has two distinct phases – the diploid sporophytic\nand the haploid gametophytic – that alternate with each other. The lengths\nof the haploid and diploid phases, and whether these phases are free–\nliving or dependent on others, vary among different groups in plants.\nThis phenomenon is called alternation of generation.  Y ou will study\nfurther details of this kingdom in Chapter 3.\n2.5 K INGDOM  A NIMALIA\nThis kingdom is characterised by heterotrophic eukaryotic organisms\nthat are multicellular and their cells lack cell walls. They directly or\nindirectly depend on plants for food. They digest their food in an internal\ncavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat. Their mode of nutrition\nis holozoic – by ingestion of food. They follow a definite growth pattern\nand grow into adults that have a definite shape and size. Higher forms\nshow elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanism. Most of them are\ncapable of locomotion.\nThe sexual reproduction is by copulation of male and female followed\nby embryological development. Salient features of various phyla are\ndescribed in Chapter 4.\n2.6 V IRUSES , V IROIDS , P RIONS  AND  L ICHENS\nIn the five kingdom classification of Whittaker there is no mention of lichens\nand some acellular organisms like viruses, viroids and prions. These are\nbriefly introduced here.\nAll of us who have suffered the ill effects of common cold or ‘flu’ know\nwhat effects viruses can have on us, even if we do not associate it with our\ncondition. Viruses did not find a place in classification since they are not\nconsidered truly ‘living’, if we understand living as those organisms that\nhave a cell structure.  The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are\ncharacterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the living cell.\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:16:33+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:13+05:30', 'title': 'ch-2.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo102.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='20 B IOLOGY\nOnce they infect a cell they take over the machinery of the host cell to replicate\nthemselves, killing the host. Would you call viruses living or non-living?\nVirus means venom or poisonous fluid. Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892)\nrecognised certain microbes as causal organism of the mosaic disease of\ntobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be smaller than bacteria\nbecause they passed through bacteria-proof filters. M.W . Beijerinek\n(1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants of  tobacco\ncould cause infection in healthy plants and named the new pathogen\n“virus” and called the fluid as Contagium vivum fluidum  (infectious living\nfluid).  W.M. Stanley (1935) showed that viruses could be crystallised\nand crystals consist largely of proteins. They are inert outside their specific\nhost cell. Viruses are obligate parasites.\nIn addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could\nbe either RNA or DNA.  No virus contains both RNA and DNA.  A virus is\na nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses\nthat infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals\nhave either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA.\nBacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are\nusually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coat\ncalled capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects the\nnucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral\ngeometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like  mumps, small pox, herpes\nand influenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, the\nsymptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing\nand vein clearing, dwarfing  and stunted growth.\nRNA Capsid\n(a)\nSheath\nHead\nTail fibres\nCollar\n(b)\nFigure 2.6  (a) Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)  (b) Bacteriophage\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:16:33+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:13+05:30', 'title': 'ch-2.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo102.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 11, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content='B IOLOGICAL  C LASSIFICATION 21\nS UMMARY\nBiological classification of plants and animals was first proposed by Aristotle on the\nbasis of simple morphological characters. Linnaeus later classified all living organisms\ninto two kingdoms – Plantae and Animalia. Whittaker proposed an elaborate five\nkingdom classification – Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. The main\ncriteria of the five kingdom classification were cell structure, body organisation,\nmode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships.\nIn the five kingdom classification, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera.\nBacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensive\nmetabolic diversity. Bacteria may be autotrophic or heterotrophic in their mode of\nnutrition. Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes such as\nChrysophytes, Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime-moulds and Protozoans. Protists\nhave defined nucleus and other membrane bound organelles. They reproduce\nboth asexually and sexually. Members of Kingdom Fungi show a great diversity\nin structures and habitat. Most fungi are saprophytic in their mode of nutrition.\nThey show asexual and sexual reproduction. Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes,\nBasidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes are the four classes under this kingdom.\nThe plantae includes all eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms. Algae,\nbryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms are included in this\ngroup. The life cycle of plants exhibit alternation of generations – gametophytic\nand sporophytic generations. The heterotrophic eukaryotic, multicellular\norganisms lacking a cell wall are included in the Kingdom Animalia. The mode of\nnutrition of these organisms is holozoic. They reproduce mostly by the sexual\nmode. Some acellular organisms like viruses and viroids as well as the lichens are\nnot included in the five kingdom system of classification.\nViroids :  In 1971, T.O. Diener discovered a new infectious agent that\nwas smaller than viruses and caused potato spindle tuber disease. It was\nfound to be a free RNA; it lacked the protein coat that is found in viruses,\nhence the name viroid. The RNA of the viroid was of low molecular weight.\nPrions :  In modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseases\nwere found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally folded\nprotein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were called\nprions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy (BSE) commonly called   mad cow disease in cattle and\nits analogous variant Cr–Jacob disease (CJD) in humans.\nLichens :  Lichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually useful\nassociations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known as\nphycobiont  and fungal component as mycobiont, which are autotrophic\nand heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungi\nprovide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner.\nSo close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one would\nnever imagine that they had two different organisms within them.  Lichens\nare very good pollution indicators – they do not grow in polluted areas.\n2024-25'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PageMaker 7.0', 'creationdate': '2022-10-14T14:16:33+00:00', 'author': 'Administrator', 'moddate': '2024-05-24T11:45:13+05:30', 'title': 'ch-2.pmd', 'source': 'database/upload/kebo102.pdf', 'total_pages': 13, 'page': 12, 'page_label': '13'}, page_content='22 B IOLOGY\nE XERCISES\n1.
